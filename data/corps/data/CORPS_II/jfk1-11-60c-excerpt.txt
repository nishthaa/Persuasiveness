Congressman Roosevelt, Attorney General Mosk - can you hear that back there? I want everybody to hear what I am going to say. {APPLAUSE} Can you hear this back there? {SPONTANEOUS-DEMONSTRATION} Well, we will go on anyway.
First of all, can anyone in this square tell me one piece of progressive legislation sponsored by Mr. Nixon or the Republican Party? {SPONTANEOUS-DEMONSTRATION} That is the party which voted 90 percent against social security in the midthirties, voted 90 percent against medical care for the aged in 1960. Mr. Nixon represents a party which voted 95 percent against tlie 25-cent minimum wage in the thirties. He represents a party which voted {SPONTANEOUS-DEMONSTRATION} - I am doing my best. Mr. Nixon represents a party which voted 90 percent against the $1.25 wage for those employees of a million dollar company. Which side is he on? Which side are the Republicans on, for progress or for standing still? {SPONTANEOUS-DEMONSTRATION}
Mr. Nixon stands where McKinley stood and Harding and Coolidge and Dewey and Landon, and I stand where Wilson stood, and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman. {APPLAUSE}
This country is going to have to move forward in the sixties. This country cannot stand still. This country needs progress and action. Thirty-five percent of our brightest boys and girls who graduate from high school never see the inside of college. I don't see any reason why four and a half million people are out of work. I don't see any reason why the prestige and influence of this country is dropping. {COMMENT="Inaudible"} I come here today and ask your support. {APPLAUSE} California is key to this election. If we can carry this State, if we can carry this State we will win. {APPLAUSE} California is a beautiful State. Mr. Nixon will enjoy it. {LAUGHTER} So I come here today and ask you to give me your hand, give me your voice, let us move this country forward. {APPLAUSE}
Ladies and gentlemen, let me just say there are only 7 more days in this campaign. Next Tuesday, November 8, you decide, you decide what kind of an America you want. You decide whether you want this country to move forward. You decide whether you want to look to the past or look to the future. {COMMENT="Inaudible"} {APPLAUSE} Viva, let's go, let's move ahead. {APPLAUSE}
