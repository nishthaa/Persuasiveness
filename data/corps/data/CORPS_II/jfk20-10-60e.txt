Ladies and gentlemen, I want to express my - thank you. Anyway, I want to express my thanks to all of you. I come over here and ask your support in Brooklyn to vote Democratic. I ask the support of all those who want to move in this country off dead center, who want to get started again. {APPLAUSE}
I ask the support of all those who believe in progressive government, the government that goes to work. {APPLAUSE}
I stand where Franklin Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson and Harry Truman stood, and I want your help. Thank you. {APPLAUSE}
