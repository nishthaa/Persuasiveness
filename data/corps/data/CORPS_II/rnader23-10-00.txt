{speech} 

Let's examine these two candidates briefly. George W. Bush's motto is "Leave no child behind" which is about all he's done in Texas. Second highest - {APPLAUSE} - second highest child hunger and highest toxic pollution exposure to Texas of any state in the nation. He's turned over a pollution control force to the polluters in return for huge campaign contributions. He's a great corporate welfare king, turning his $600,000 borrowed investment into a $14 million profit in the Texas Rangers' baseball team after his corporate buddies got the city of Arlington to build a new stadium with tax dollars. Inflated the team's value, he sells out for fourteen million bucks -- his only business success. 

Al Gore is a more interesting character. {LAUGHTER} On any given day I can't figure out whether he's the great impostor or the great pretender. You look at all his promises and insights in his book, "Earth in the Balance;" you'll never meet a politician who's broken more of them or turned his back on more of them. Blind ambition - just no -- no doubt about it. He will go with the power flow. Here's a man who wanted solar energy; he's never made a speech on it in eight years. That really takes guts, you know -- {LAUGHTER} to make a speech for renewable energy? Solar and renewable solar thermal, and wind power -- such political fortitude -- {LAUGHTER} -- go down as one of the profiles of courage in American political history. {LAUGHTER} 

You can be part of a very exciting, very productive political effort. At this stage, you'll be pioneers and there are some people who are pioneers, some people who are not. We're going to get millions of votes on November 7th as a launching pad for expanding this political movement in future elections. But right away, we have won in a variety of ways. We have tens of thousands of people coming in progressive political activity, including many, many thousands of young people on college campuses. We want to appeal to the idealism of youth, for one reason. -- for the idealism of youth that has been turned off by a political system the young people say is nothing more than all about money and lying -- money and lying. 34% of 18 to 24-year-olds voted in 1996. That's the lowest since eighteen year olds got the right to vote almost 30 years ago. We want you back into the political movement. If you ever hear a fellow student say, "I'm not turned on politics," give that student a history book, because if you don't turn on politics, down to the air you breathe, the water you drink, the racial profiling you detest, the health insurance many people don't have, and on and on. If you don't turn on politics, politics will turn on you in very disagreeable ways. {APPLAUSE} 

One million Americans offering 100 hours-a-year of volunteer time and raising a hundred dollars, given the depth and breadth of this Green Party platform out of the Denver convention in June, will make this party a majoritarian contender in a very few years. All kinds of talent is coming out of the woodwork because of this campaign. All kinds of people of all ages who had given up, given up as part of the peace movement, or given up as part of the environmental movement, or given up as part of the inner-city revitalization efforts, they're not giving up. They're coming in. We don't want future generations to look back on this and say, "ours was a generation that refused to give up so little in order to achieve so much." This may be the last generation that has that indulgence. We want future generations to look back on us and say, "here is a generation that utilized its time in an important fashion; applied its talent in a productive fashion; and defined justice as the great work of human beings on earth. Here is a generation that stood tall, a generation that brought the world environmental justice, peace, disarmament, democracy, and the opportunities of all people to make the most of their lives. Here is a generation that looked destiny in the eye and said we're going to meet it." Thank you. {APPLAUSE}
