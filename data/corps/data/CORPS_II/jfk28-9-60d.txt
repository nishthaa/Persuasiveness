Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to have you meet Mayor Wagner, of New York, Arthur Levitt, the comptroller of the State, and Mr. Prendergast, the State chairman, We do not come to Niagara to see the falls. We came to See you and the people of northern New York. I am a candidate, as you know, for the Office of the Presidency of the United States, and I run as a Democrat. {APPLAUSE}
Mr. Nixon has said that party labels don't matter so much this year, that the question is the man. I think it is also the man and I think it is also the party. I think parties do stand for something. They ought to. Grover Cleveland, a Governor of New York as well as a President, said what good is a politician unless he stands for something and what good is a party unless it stands for something.
I want to make it very clear what we stand for in 1960. The Democratic Party stands for a stronger America; not strong if, but when or something, but strong this year, now, period. {APPLAUSE} I want to make it very clear that I consider it to be a central responsibility of the man who is elected President of the United States on November 8, to send a message to the Congress in the first 3 months of his office which will request appropriations which will make us in 1961, 1962, and 1963 in a position to stand up to the Soviet Union or the Chinese Communists or anyone else who wishes to threaten our security. I think it is incumbent and I think it is primary, and I think it will provide us, and we can provide the kind of security that we need.
Secondly, I stand for full employment in the United States. {APPLAUSE} There are more people out of work this August than at any time except for the two recessions. Here in this country you have seen it. I think that the Federal Government and the States and the companies have to devote themselves to the goal of providing work for men who want it, for men who need it, and providing work under good conditions. That has been the goal of the party that I represent since Woodrow Wilson, and it is the goal of the Democratic Party today.
I have served on the Labor Committees of the Congress for 14 years, and I have traveled in the last year to nearly every State in the Union. I have been to parts of New York and to West Virginia and Pennsylvania, and southern Illinois, and I think that it is a problem which is going to face the next President of the United States in the first 6 months. I don't think it is any secret for Mr. Khrushchev that the U.S. economy today is at a plateau, that our steel mills are working 50 percent, and I don't want to see the winter of 1961 slide as it did in the winter of 1958 and 1954 and 1949. This country cannot maintain its leadership unless our people are working and our machines are working.
The Soviet Union last week produced as much steel as the United States, and the reason, of course, is because our steel mills work 54 percent of their capacity. What affects the steel mills affects this country. If this country is moving ahead, if we have fiscal and monetary policies which stimulate employment, if we have a defense policy which provides not only protection for the United States but strength for our economy, if we provide security for our people, then I think we provide security for freedom.
My program is brief: that is to strengthen this country, because what we are in this country speaks far louder than what we say. If we are building a strong society here, and a strong economy, if we are providing work for our people, there isn't any question that we can outproduce any country in the world, that our security will be assured. We only fail when we don't measure up to our own potential. It is my policy, and I think the policy of the Democratic Party, and I think the policy of this country, to start this country moving again. That is the program to which we commit ourselves. I will be glad to answer any questions that anyone might have. {APPLAUSE}
