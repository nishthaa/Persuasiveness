Thank you very much. I'm honored to have this opportunity to recognize these pioneers of aviation. With all of America, Nancy and I followed the Voyager's progress along each leg of its fabulous flight, with alternating feelings of nervousness and hope and fear and elation -- but mostly an overwhelming pride in these two courageous Americans and their historic mission. We watched as Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager hooked a ride on a typhoon over the Pacific Ocean. And we held our breath as they piloted their way between thunderclouds on one side and the hostile airspace over Vietnam on the other. Dick had already been pulled out of the South China Sea once many years ago when, after more than a hundred combat missions over North Vietnam, enemy ground fire had downed his fighter plane. And I'm sure that Dick felt, and we all agreed, that one dip in the ocean was enough. {LAUGHTER}

We laughed and shook our head, but in a way understood the local official in Thailand who refused to believe some cockamamie story about a plane that was flying around the world on one tank of gas. {LAUGHTER} And we've cheered when, just past Sri Lanka, Voyager broke the record for the longest nonstop flight. And then when we saw you coming back home -- so ungainly, yet so graceful, flying into the desert landing strip at Edwards Air Force Base -- well, that was just about the best Christmas present America could have had. And, of course, waiting for you back home was the man whose brilliant design, determination, and entrepreneurship got the Voyager program off the ground -- Dick's brother, Burt Rutan.

For those of us old enough to remember, the flight of the Voyager brought us back to the days of those magnificient men and their flying machines. And you reminded us all that aviation history is still being written by men and women with the spirit of adventure and derring-do. On December the 23d, 1986, the name Voyager joined the distinguished family of airborne technological breakthroughs that began with the Wright Flyer and includes the Spirit of St. Louis and the glamorous Glennis. And three men -- or new names, I should say, will be added to the column headed "The Right Stuff." Along with Orville and Wilbur Wright, Charles Lindbergh and Chuck Yeager, history will now record Dick Rutan, Jeana Yeager, and Burt Rutan.

And so, it's my honor to present the Presidential Citizens Medal to Richard G. Rutan:

Dick Rutan has inspired a Nation with his record-setting, non-stop aerial circumnavigation of the globe. A veteran of 325 combat missions during the Vietnam conflict, Dick Rutan had already proven himself a patriot and a hero. The historic flight of the Voyager demonstrated that he is also a man of vision -- and a man with the skill, determination, and just plain courage to make his vision a reality.

Jeana Yeager:

When Jeana Yeager landed at Edwards Air Force Base, completing her historic and record-setting non-stop flight around the globe aboard the Voyager, America gained another hero. She reminded us all that aviation history is still being written by men and women with the spirit of adventure and derring-do.

And to Elbert L. Rutan:

Burt Rutan is the driving force behind the brilliant voyage of the aircraft he designed and built. His initiative, originality, and entrepreneurship have shown us anew the remarkable results that individual determination and enterprise can attain, no matter how formidable the challenge. The record-setting flight of the Voyager is an inspiration to all America.
