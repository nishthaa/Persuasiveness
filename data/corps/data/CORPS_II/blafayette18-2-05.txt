Thank you very much, Ambassador, for that introduction, and to our distinguished Secretary, Dr. Rice, and to one of my favorite people, Dorothy Height, and to Coach. You just really made a great statement. I'm very proud to be in the company of such fine and noble people today. And to all of those who are present -- dignitaries, Ambassadors, Consuls, and all of our young people who have joined us -- my remarks will be brief. And I wanted Dr. Rice to know that I'll be preaching at a Presbyterian church this coming Sunday {LAUGHTER} in Tuskegee, Alabama. And so that means -- she understands what I mean by that. That means that although I'm a Baptist preacher, I won't take long. {LAUGHTER} We only have five minutes to speak and I'm going to give Coach two of mine because we made a deal. {LAUGHTER}

I was born in the segregated south in Tampa, Florida, in Ybor City, and I grew up there understanding that there was separation between the races, and in our schools, in our playgrounds, parks. Some of you don't realize that the libraries were segregated. They had separate libraries for black folks, and to make you feel good about it, it was a George Washington Carver branch. {LAUGHTER}

So we grew up in that circumstance and the buses were segregated, and I often thought it was so unfair and inhumane to force white people to sit in the front of the bus. {LAUGHTER} They couldn't help it. They didn't choose to be born white. And if you were white, you were not allowed to go to the back. And I remember the feeling I had many times when I saw the little white children get on the bus and start running to the back and they'd snatch them back. {LAUGHTER ; APPLAUSE} It was an awful thing. {LAUGHTER}

And they, see, every black person on the bus could see every white person because they were all sitting in the front. {LAUGHTER} So we used to watch them. And the other thing was this. Some of you know about these seats now in your cars where you can press a button on a cold day and your seat warms up. We had that all of the time on the back of the bus. {LAUGHTER} That back seat was on the motor. {LAUGHTER} Black only. If you were white, you had to sit up there and the door opened every time someone got on. Now just because they were white, that was not right. {LAUGHTER}

And then when the bus had a wreck, most of the time it was in the front and all the white folks' faces were -- {LAUGHTER} And the worst thing happened, they told those white kids the reason they were sitting up front was because they were better than the folks in the back. How could anyone do that to their children, tell them that they were better than someone else simply because of the color of their skin?

That's a cruel thing to put in the mind of your children. It made it difficult for them to live in the world with the rest of the people, going around acting arrogant and people are laughing at you all over the world. I try to spend my time explaining, you know, so folks wouldn't feel so, you know, hostile towards them, but it's a hard job.

We must change that. This is what our mission has been in the Civil Rights movement. Martin Luther King is not able to be here with us today because he was cut down in Memphis, but I was with him the morning of the assassination. In fact, I was en route to Washington, D.C., to open up the headquarters for the Poor People's Campaign when he was assassinated. I found out after I landed at what once was Washington National. But that morning he told me something that I never forgot and it has changed the course of my entire life. That was, he said, "Bernard, the next movement we're going to have is to institutionalize and internationalize nonviolence."

So then I took off to law school and Harvard University, trying to learn how to institutionalize things. We're working on it. I'm proud today we have a Secretary of State who understands how to stand fast, the quarterback, yes, on our team. The one who knows how to take insults, and yet smiles. The one who has a mission, and that is to win the hearts of her enemies. That's what nonviolence is all about. Martin Luther King taught us well, and because of those lessons we're going to go a long way.

America is not what it can be. It's a great nation, but we can be greater now. We've always made important achievements in the area of human rights and liberty. And because of America, many nations enjoy democracy, while we're working on improving our own. And we know we have work to do, and we've got to continue that work to make a more perfect nation. That's our challenge for the future.

And finally I want to say to Dorothy Height, my mentor, those of us in SNCC, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, dropped out of school to go on the Freedom Rides. We dropped out in the middle of our final exams so we could make sure that Freedom Ride continued after the bombing in Anniston, Alabama. I was on that ride.

I was one of those in Birmingham, where we stayed all night trying to get a bus out because bus drivers refused to drive us because they were afraid for their own lives. I was with that group in Montgomery, Alabama, when they waited out at the waiting room at the bus station and clobbered us and beat us to the ground, hospitalized some. We're going to be celebrating that first Sunday in March next year, that anniversary of the sit-ins, rather the Freedom Rides.

I was there in Parchman, Alabama, in prison, because we were standing up for our rights, refusing to take a back seat to justice. But of all my journeys, I want you to know that one of the things that made me what I am today is Dorothy Height, because we came from the battlefield when the war was over. Her organization, the National Council of Negro Women, gave us scholarships to go back to school. And I want to say today to the Heights, you knew what we'd need even if we didn't know. And I want to publicly thank you for all of us students in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. You had our back. {APPLAUSE}

We've seen our country make some great strides in the past. My final comment is, Secretary Rice, you ain't seen nothing yet. {LAUGHTER ; APPLAUSE}
