{speech} 

Ladies and gentlemen, whenever we feel tired and a little down, we come to Louisville. {APPLAUSE} I must say that you have treated me, a northerner, with more generosity, perhaps, than he deserves, but I am very grateful for it. {APPLAUSE} This is the fourth time in this campaign we have come to Kentucky. That is more separate trips than any other State of the Union, and Kentucky deserves it. {APPLAUSE}
We will make a promise to you that we will not come back to Louisville again if you will promise that on November 8, you will give us a great majority in this city and county. {APPLAUSE}
There is a month left in this campaign, and I believe it is a month in which we can bring home the truth to the American people about the problems that face us, the truth about the Mr. Nixon's record in the Congress {APPLAUSE} and the truth shall make us free. And I believe on November 8, when the people of this country make their judgment, what they want their country to be, I think they are coming with us. Thank you very much, and now we will all go to bed. Thank you. {APPLAUSE}
