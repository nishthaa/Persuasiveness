Thank you, everybody. What an amazing day to be a teacher. {LAUGHTER} We are actually at the White House in the Rose Garden standing next to the President of the United States and the Secretary of Education. It doesn't get much better than that. Thank you, Mr. President, for recognizing America's teachers and inviting us to your home. I know our lives will be forever changed for the better.
I would like to thank my fellow State Teachers of the Year. The path that led us to this beautiful Rose Garden was not an easy journey. Rather, it required much hard work and the highest level of commitment to the education of our nation's children. We all share the honor and privilege to stand here today and help represent teachers, and more importantly, our students.
When I was named Connecticut State Teacher of the Year, a local reporter approached me and asked me what makes a good teacher. I told him that passion, professionalism, and perseverance are three main traits a good teacher must display in the classroom -- and they are. But as I drove home that day, the reporter's question began to nag at me because I knew good teachers possess some other special quality that make them able to connect to students, to make students feel important and wanted.
I pondered the question because, although he may not have realized at the time -- the reporter got a 10-second sound bite and I was handed a Rubik's Cube -- the question did not seem to have an easy answer, because good teachers use a variety of teaching techniques to help children learn well. But the investigator in me was looking for a common thread that linked all good teachers. And I finally came to realize that the very best teachers have one common quality: They know how to read a story. They know that each and every child arrives at their classroom door with a unique and intriguing, yet incomplete story.
The really good teachers are able to read a child's story, and recognize the remarkable opportunity to help author that story. The really good teachers know how to script confidence and success onto the blank pages. They know how to edit the mistakes. And they want to help write a happy ending. Really good teachers know they have the ability to make a child happy or sad, to make a child feel confident or unsure, to make a child feel wanted or discarded. And students know when we care, when we care enough to read their stories.
I teach and mentor at-risk teenagers, because too many of the pages of their stories are filled with anxiety, depression, substance abuse, academic failure, and despair. They feel disconnected from school, community, and often their own families. I teach these young adults because they are among the most complex population to educate, and therefore challenge my ability as an educator. And I teach them because they provide me plenty of opportunity to help rewrite their stories, to help them compose a happy ending.
And that is what all the really good teachers have in common. They know how to read a child's story, and understand that students who suffer from academic, emotional, or physical disabilities need the type of positive relationships teachers can provide, because too often we are the only functional adult in their lives. They want us to colorize their black and white world, and they want to be given something much more than an education -- they want us to help heal their pain. And, yes, teachers are amazing healers. We help speed the healing process every time we compliment a student, or make them laugh, or spend a few private moments listening to their story.
I thank you all, my fellow teachers, for taking the time to read your student's stories.
And, Mr. President, Secretary Duncan, I know you will join all of us in finding the courage, the strength, and the wisdom to teach all people how to read a child's story. Thank you. {APPLAUSE}
Thank you very much. Now I'd like to spend a moment, if I may, to introduce my family. They are my rocks. My wife, Susan -- {APPLAUSE} ; my daughter, Andrea -- {APPLAUSE} ; my son, Thomas -- {APPLAUSE} ; and two very special people who have been really my surrogate parents for over 30 years, my father-in-law and mother-in-law, Joe and Joan. {APPLAUSE}
{OTHER-SPEAK} Well, thank you everybody. And with that, enjoy the day. I'm going to shake a few hands, and I'm sure the First Lady will, as well. {/OTHER-SPEAK} {APPLAUSE}
