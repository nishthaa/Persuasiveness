{speech} 

Madam President, I wish to join with previous speakers and other chairmen of political groups in welcoming the President-in-Office of the Council here today. Like them, I think that what she has done by coming here is to create an atmosphere of trust between the Council and this Parliament. I welcome the initiative that has been taken and I hope that Mrs Thatcher has set a precedent here to be followed by future Presidents of the Council. {APPLAUSE} 

Like the political cooperation of the Foreign Ministers, the Council itself is working, in ways not provided for in the actual Treaty, and it depends on precedent and tradition for its future working. I sincerely hope that will mean that not only will the President come here and report after Council meetings but that there will be an opportunity also of asking questions and obtaining answers either from the President concerning such Council meetings or from the President of the Council of Foreign Ministers. Turning to the points which were made by the Prime Minister, it is of course disappointing that no further concrete progress was made either at the November summit or at the Foreign Ministers meeting of Monday and Tuesday of this week. They were trying to tackle four areas which are extremely difficult, but like other colleagues in this House, I hope that these can be resolved. I ask myself whether the Council over which the Prime Minister presided should not in future concentrate on the big issues and leave the details to be settled by the ministers in the other Councils on the basis of guidelines given by the Council. I think one must be not too depressed by the fact that no agreement has been reached. I think one must look at the more concrete and positive results of that Council. There is no doubt that progress was made, not only in understanding between ministers and between members of the Council, but also in areas relating to the economic future of the Community, the necessity to deal with the grave problems which do face the Community. I do believe that unless we deal with such major issues as unemployment and the high levels of inflation in all our countries, then the Community will not have the necessary momentum to continue. I believe that the fact that the Council did address itself to these problems, and we heard the result of that in the Prime Minister's speech just now, is to be really welcomed. I am glad, for instance, that there is going to be a review of the EMS in March and I sincerely hope that all members of the ten countries will by that time be members of it. {APPLAUSE} 

These are indeed grave days that we live in, Madam President, the situation just evolving at the moment in Poland is giving us all grave cause for anxiety. It is comforting to know that our leaders in the Council are together in their solidarity concerning the need to help Poland and the need to make certain that there is no outside intervention from any other country such as Russia. I am quite certain that this House will want to give the message to the Prime Minister in future meetings that it is essential that we do all we can to help the Polish people regain—I think that is the right word to use now—their freedom and democracy.

In conclusion, Madam President, may I say that the British Presidency during the last six months is to be congratulated on the number of Ministers who have come to this House. The innovation of having ten foreign ministers, led by the Foreign Minister of the United Kingdom, was to be greatly welcomed, and I sincerely hope that the precedents that have been set will be followed, as I am sure they will be, by future presidencies.

Although is has not, perhaps, been the final conclusion which we can all say was what we wanted at the beginning, I do believe that the solidarity which has been shown by the Prime Minister in her reaffirmation of the need for solidarity in Europe is something we must cherish in this Parliament and do everything we can to further. That is the way that our citizens and our electors are going to be able to gain benefit from Europe, and I strongly support what she has said. {APPLAUSE}
