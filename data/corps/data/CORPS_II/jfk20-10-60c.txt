Ladies and gentleman, I have come over here to Brooklyn to ask your help in this campaign. We are waging a campaign to build a stronger country in order to protect our security, protect the future of freedom, and also to move this country forward, provide jobs for our people, get off dead center, and I come over here to ask your help in this campaign in a great Democratic county. Thank you very much. {APPLAUSE}
I would like to have you meet - you all know former Congressman O'Toole. I served in the Congress with him 14 years ago. And here is going to be your next Congressman from this district, Congressman-to-be Carey. {APPLAUSE} And Judge Ughetta, who is running for the Court of Common Pleas. {APPLAUSE} And Assemblyman Turpin. {APPLAUSE} And Al Burns. I want to thank you very much, and I appreciate your coming out. I would be glad to shake hands with anybody. {APPLAUSE}
