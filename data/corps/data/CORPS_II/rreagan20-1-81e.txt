Shoreham Hotel (10:14 p.m.)

Our host and hostess, to Mrs. Shipley, and I know that you've met our son and Doria, his wife, earlier, Charlie and Mrs. Wick:

You know, I have to open this not only by thanking all of you for being here, for all that you've done and to make this such a wonderful time and then for those -- to Bob Gray and Charlie Wick, who is cochairman, really put together what I think has been a very wonderful and enjoyable inaugural several days. I said several days, because it really has been going on, and it's been a wonderful thing.

I'm grateful to all the entertainers who are here, Bob Stack and all of them who are working so hard. I'm not going to try names, or I'll miss someone. And they have donated their services. They helped during the campaign, all of them. And we're grateful to them.

I thought that maybe I could just give you a little bit of a news item. Since you've been in here, you might not have heard this, known this. The latest word is -- and as I said in the places we've visited already tonight, I refuse to call them hostages; they're prisoners of war -- the last word I had, in Algeria they have deplaned from the Algerian planes, and they are preparing to get into the American planes, 52 of them, all of them hale and hearty, all of them just fine.

Now, we don't have very much time here, because they have us on the circuit. And they've told us that if we move right along that we can get to every ball, and it'll only take 4\1/2\ hours. {LAUGHTER} So, we're delighted to -- this is number five.

Someone just said that Nancy's beautiful, and I agree with him. They want to hear from you. I think it's a command performance.

{OTHER-SPEAK} Well, thank you. I've left this to my husband all along, so you've surprised me. But thank you all for coming. And we're delighted to see you, and we hope that you're having as good a time as we're having. Thank you for everything you've done for us in the past, and we appreciate it, and we never would be here without you. And we love you all. {/OTHER-SPEAK} 

Let me just conclude, because I know they're signaling that we have to move on. But let me just tell you this one thing, and this, again, is due to the people, our two cochairmen there, their plan, something unusual that's never happened before.

The people who came to the first inaugural almost 200 years ago, of course, did so on horseback and stagecoach. Today all over America, there are people that are attending this inaugural by satellite, because in addition to the 10 balls here in Washington, there are in the neighborhood of a hundred in cities all over the United States who are attending these balls by closed-circuit television, by satellite. And all of the money that they have raised in those towns for those balls is going to a local charity in each one of those communities.

And having said that, I'd just add as a postscript to what I said this morning. When I look at you -- and you're much closer -- {LAUGHTER} -- and I can see you better than I could this morning -- but I am more than ever convinced we don't have a thing to worry about, not the American people, because between all of us, between us, we're going to straighten things out, and we're going to take the high road.

Thank you.
