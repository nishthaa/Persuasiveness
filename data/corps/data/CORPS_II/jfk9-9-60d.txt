Governor Brown, ladies and gentlemen I am not going to make a speech in this rain. The only satisfaction you get is that it is raining on the just and unjust, Republicans and Democrats. I want to thank you for coming out. We are going to win this election and we are going to win it right here in the the State of California. I ask your help. {APPLAUSE}
I don't think that anyone could have lived in this valley for the last years under Republican and Democratic administrations without realizing there is a great difference between them. We believe in going ahead. We believe in doing better than we are doing, and they believe in standing still. I ask your help. I think we can start this valley, this State, and this country on the move again next January. Thank you very much. {APPLAUSE}
I want you to meet my sister, who lives in California, who left Massachusetts because she did not like the weather there, who is out here. My sister, Pat Lawford. {LAUGHTER ; APPLAUSE} I would like to have you meet Senator "Scoop" Jackson, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, from Washington, who will say a word to you.
