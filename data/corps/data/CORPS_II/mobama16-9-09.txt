Good afternoon, everyone.
{AUDIENCE} Good afternoon! {/AUDIENCE} 
Awww. {LAUGHTER} We're thrilled to welcome all of you to the White House today as we honor some of America's top Olympic and Paralympic athletes and express our excitement about the opportunity to host the 2016 Summer Olympic/Paralympic Games.
I want to thank Mayor Daley for that warm and heartfelt introduction, but I also want to thank him for his outstanding work to prepare Chicago's bid, and for his visionary leadership to move a city to great places, a city that is so near and dear to my heart, to our hearts, to the Obama family.
And I want to say a special hello to all these wonderful young people who are here that so politely said hello to me -- {LAUGHTER} -- who've come here from our local schools in our area. Hey, guys.
{AUDIENCE} Hey! {/AUDIENCE} 
Hey! I think it's safe to say that everyone here is really feeling the Olympic spirit today, right?
{AUDIENCE} Yes! {/AUDIENCE} 
That's right. {APPLAUSE} Yeah! We can do this. {APPLAUSE} And I know that we are pretty eager to see some judo, right? We're going to see some gymnastics today. And what else? Fencing. You should have seen the President in there fencing. {LAUGHTER} It was pathetic. {LAUGHTER} But he passed the baton really well.
And I want to recognize the Olympians, the Paralympians, and the coaches -- not just for their extraordinary athletic achievements, but also for taking the time to inspire young people today here at the White House, and every day in communities across this nation. You all make us so very proud of this country.
As we can see from today's event, the Olympics isn't just about what happens in one city every two or four years. It's not just about those weeks when we watch the greatest athletes in the world push themselves to new heights of achievement. It's also about how a nation is transformed during the years leading up to the Games, and it's also about the legacy that lasts in those cities long after the closing ceremonies are over.
The Olympic charter states that, by "blending sport with culture and education," the Olympics aims "to create a way of life based on the joy of effort, the educational value of good example."
And that's what I'm reminded of today -- how the Olympic Games teach important lessons and set an important example for so many young people.
I'm reminded of the commitment to excellence that the Games embody -- the belief that no matter where you're from, or what your background is, that if you dream big enough and work hard enough, there are no limits to what you can achieve.
I'm reminded of the lifestyles that the Games promote -- the commitment to physical activity and nutrition that are so important for a healthy life, and that we're working so hard for to reach in this nation.
I'm reminded of the mission of the Paralympic Games that it fulfills, opening the highest levels of athletic competition to anyone with the talent and drive to succeed -- men and women who refuse to let their disabilities limit their horizons.
And I'm reminded of the example of citizenship and service our Olympic and Paralympic athletes are setting every day all across the country. More than 2,500 of those athletes have already signed up to be athletic ambassadors for Chicago 2016's World Sport Chicago Initiative. They're committing to work as coaches and mentors, and holding sports clinics to encourage young people to stay active. They've already reached more than 30,000 children in just Chicago alone. And they're planning to take this initiative across the nation, including right here in D.C. What you guys were doing today -- you went out to some of our local schools and you talked to young people about what's important about athletics and nutrition.
And I have to say that I'm proud of those efforts, but I am also proud of the fact that Chicago may be the host. I cannot think of a better city to host the 2016 Games than my hometown. I was born and raised on the South Side of Chicago. You probably already know that. So I know a lot about this city. We have our home so close to many of the proposed venues. We can say that we are so pumped up about this, aren't we? {LAUGHTER}
And I can tell you, personally, what makes Chicago the ideal home for the 2016 Games and I'm very excited to be able to do that in Copenhagen. It's not just the infrastructure or the resources of the city, and it's not just the beautiful parks, because there are many. It's not that gorgeous lakefront that so many will see during the Olympic Games. And it's not just the excellent public transportation and the accommodations. What makes Chicago such a great host is its people. It's truly the people.
Nobody loves sports like the people of Chicago -- trust me. I have spent endless hours -- {LAUGHTER} -- in front of baseball TV games, you name it. Whether it's football or soccer, baseball, boxing or a good marathon -- Chicagoans know how to enjoy sports. You know, you have to admit, even White Sox fans are impressed by the fact that even though the Cubs haven't won a World Series in centuries, Cubs games sell out. {LAUGHTER} Everybody's there. It doesn't matter. Win or lose, we are going to watch the Cubs. {LAUGHTER ; APPLAUSE} 
And if you want to see a truly international city, there's no place like Chicago. It is home to more than 130 countries speaking more than 100 different languages. So even the athletes that are going to be travelling halfway around the world to get to Chicago, they might find that they have more of a home court advantage than they might even think when they come to this city.
And Mayor Daley has been working around the clock on this 2016 bid. He has poured his heart and soul into this effort, along with everybody else on the Olympic Committee. The Chicago City Council has voted unanimously to back it. Nearly 20,000 Chicagoans from all walks of life have already volunteered their time and effort to support it. And the organizers are working to ensure that each of the city's 77 individual neighborhoods is part of the Games in some way, shape, or form -- because that city, our city, believes that everyone has to feel included in this extraordinary moment.
And I know that Barack and I would feel such tremendous pride to see the Olympic torch burning brightly in the city that we love so much. So I am honored, deeply honored, to have the opportunity to travel to Copenhagen to make the case for my hometown. {APPLAUSE} And I am also honored, as always, and pleased to introduce someone who's going to talk a little bit more about what hosting the 2016 Games would mean for America -- my husband, the President of the United States, Barack Obama. {APPLAUSE}
