{speech} 

Anyone playing hooky? Well, we're here today because Columbia has some of the best schools and best students in America. And the schools here are helping America prepare for the 21st century. One of America's best is Ridgeway Elementary. And one of America's best high schools is Rockbridge High, the home of the Bruins. I know that Immaculate Conception is here and the 701 Cub Scout troop is here. {APPLAUSE} There they are.

Well, my thanks to all of you. You know, maybe what you all have achieved here with regard to your education setup, maybe I should take some of you back to Washington and we'd straighten out some of those puzzle palaces on the Potomac. Well, I thank you all very much for coming out. I know that I have to move on, we've got quite a busy schedule, but thank you all. Thank you for the musical greeting. I used to be a drum major in a band just like yours myself in Dixon, Illinois. Well, thank you all very much for coming out and for this warm welcome. God bless you all.
