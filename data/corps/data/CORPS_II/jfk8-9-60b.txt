Governor Egan, Senator Bartlett, Senator Gruening, Congressman Rivers, and ladies and gentlemen, during the Democratic Convention I said that if I were nominated by that convention, I would start my campaign in the State of Alaska. That was a pledge I meant to keep. I am keeping it here now. I can assure you that I will keep all the other commitments that we make in this campaign. {APPLAUSE}
I understand that there has been some discussion about where the State capital of this State should be located. Let me say to you that I don't know enough about that to comment on it, or at least I know too much to comment on it, but I will say to you that if the Democrats are elected this year we will return the capital of the free world to Washington. {APPLAUSE} We will once again in that Capital send out streams of energy and vitality which can mean so much to the growth of Alaska, so much to the growth of the United States, and so much to those men and women who share our common aspiration to be free.
This is a great State. In a very real sense, Alaska typifies the new frontier. I am delighted to be here today. I came in 1958 to participate in the election of a great Senator, Senator Gruening. He and Senator Bartlett and Congressman Rivers speak powerfully for the State of Alaska. But they know and I know that this State will not begin to realize its potential until we have not only a Democratic Congress, but until we have a Democratic President who believes in the future of Alaska. {APPLAUSE}
I was here in the snow. I am glad to come here in the summer. In any case, I know I am among friends. You are very nice to come and welcome me to the airport. Thank you very much. {APPLAUSE}
