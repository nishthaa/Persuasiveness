Ladies and gentlemen: We are here in Indiana to ask your help. Indiana has not gone Democratic in a Presidential election since 1936, and I think it is time it did. {APPLAUSE}
Nixon, speaking in Boston the other night, said I was another Truman, and I said he was another Dewey, and he is. {LAUGHTER ; APPLAUSE} Any candidate who considers our program extreme, any candidate who is opposed to $1.25 minimum wage, or medical care for the aged or a decent housing bill, any candidate whose party is only able to get our steel mills working 50 percent of capacity, who is only able after the recession in 1958 to have this economy drifting along - I think we need a change. {APPLAUSE}
I ask your help in this campaign. I think we can win in Indiana and I think we can win in the country. We are going to have a Democratic Congress. To have a Republican President and the Congress and the President fighting over the next 4 years, without any legislation, without this country moving ahead, I believe the American people are going to choose to go with the Democrats again.
I come here today and ask your help in a tough fight here in Indiana. If we can win in this State, we can win the election. So I would appreciate your helping us. {APPLAUSE}
