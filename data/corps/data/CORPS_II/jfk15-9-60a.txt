Mr. Mayor, needless to say this is not my automobile. {LAUGHTER} I want to express my thanks to all of you for coming out with the mayor with the keys. I am, as you know, the Democratic candidate for the Office of the Presidency of the United States. I will tell you what our policy is, and that is to advance the power and influence and prestige of this country so that we are secure and so that we can live in peace and so that we advance the cause of freedom around the world. {APPLAUSE} And what is our policy here in the United States? It is to make more secure the life of our citizens, to make sure that those who want to work can find a job, to make sure that those who are retired have security, for those who are retired to have housing and medical care. This is a great country, but I think we can make it a greater country. This is a powerful country, but I think we can make it a more powerful country. I ask your help in this campaign. I ask you to join us in this great effort, to start the United States moving again in the great years of the 1960's. I ask your help. We are going to win it. {APPLAUSE}
