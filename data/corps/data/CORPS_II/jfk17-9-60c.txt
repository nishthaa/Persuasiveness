I want to thank all of you. I understand this was a special day, and I want to thank you for coming in very much. It added to my education. Let me just say that I appreciate the plaque. That plaque describes the farm program which I think the Democratic Party stands for, and which I stand for. {APPLAUSE}
I am glad to say that this is not a commitment which is made at election time, but a commitment which has been made and kept by Harold Cooley, the Senators from this State, the Congressmen from this State, Congressman Bonner, and the rest.
As the standard bearer of the Democratic Party it is to that program that I commit the party on this occasion, and if elected, in January, 1961. Thank you. {APPLAUSE}
