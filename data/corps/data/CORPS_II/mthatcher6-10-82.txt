When a country has problems it is always the young people whom it calls upon to serve the cause of freedom and justice. {COMMENT="Hear, hear"} And I think we can be very proud indeed that our young generation has served with equal bravery, distinction and honour as any previous generation. {AUDIENCE} Hear, hears {/AUDIENCE} {SUSTAINED APPLAUSE ; CHEERS} 

And I think all of those who have been at home have felt a new oneness. We really have felt that we are citizens of a free country. {AUDIENCE} Hear, hear {/AUDIENCE} {CHEERS ; APPLAUSE} {COMMENT="Music— Glenn Miller"}
