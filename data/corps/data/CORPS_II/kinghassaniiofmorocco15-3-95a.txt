Mr. President and great friend, Mrs. Clinton, ladies and gentlemen. Once again, I wish to thank you, Mr. President, for your warm welcome and hospitality; and thank Mrs. Clinton for putting in the special touch that will make this evening a memorable event.

The important talks we had today, Mr. President, were stamped with healthy frankness. They were motivated mainly by a major aim to bring tensions down, particularly in the Middle East. Now, the Soviet Union is no longer. The task of the United States of America is not any easier; rather, because it's better identified, this task is more delicate.

We remain convinced, however, that because of its genius, its creative faculties, and its altruism, the American people will tackle successfully global issues. This I know you will accomplish with sensitiveness and humanism, despite the specificity and diversity of the issues on hand.

I pray all of you, ladies and gentlemen, to join me to raising a toast to the President of the United States of America and my great friend, Mr. Bill Clinton. Long life to the United States of America. Long life to the Moroccan-American friendship.
