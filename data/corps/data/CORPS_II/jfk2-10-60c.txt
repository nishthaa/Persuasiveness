I understand that Daniel Webster used to address 100,000 people without any trouble at all, and without a mike, so it should be easy for us. We are a little softer than they used to be, however.
I want to thank you very much for a generous reception. I am particularly proud that I am associated on the ticket here in Minnesota with your distinguished Congressman who has served this district and served the country, Joe Karth, whom I know you are going to send back to the House of Representatives {APPLAUSE} and with your great Governor, Orville Freeman, who was generous enough to nominate me at the convention. But that is not the reason you ought to reelect him. The reason you ought to reelect him is because he has served this State, and I don't know of a more difficult job in the United States than to be Governor of an expanding State with problems of education, taking care of our older people, the mentally retarded and all the rest. I think Orville Freeman has moved forward with courage. I am confident that this State is going to respond to that kind of leadership. {APPLAUSE}
And Hubert, of course, is surely going to he reelected. He prepared me and took me out into spring training, which was far tougher than it is this fall. {LAUGHTER} I chased him all over Wisconsin and then all over the hills of West Virginia, and now we are running against Mr. Nixon. I ask your help in this campaign. The candidates kind of pour through these cities and leave, but for the next 6 weeks the campaign in Minnesota is in your hands. I think it is an important election. I think we can do a great job for this country and this State and I feel that the Democratic Party which in other days and in other crises has produced great leadership, I think we can do the same job again. I ask your help in this campaign. I ask you to join us in crossing the new frontier. I feel we can be of service to our country, and in serving our country we can serve a great cause all around the world. Thank you very much. {APPLAUSE}
