That constitutes an event. {LAUGHTER}

{OTHER-SPEAK} That is an event. That is an event. {/OTHER-SPEAK} {LAUGHTER}

Thank you so much, Mr. Vice President, for your very kind introduction. That really make me lose my words, but it's a good thing that I have written them so I can -- {LAUGHTER} -- I can speak now.

Mr. President, on behalf of the Greek American Orthodox community of this blessed land, I have the great honor to wholeheartedly congratulate you on your historic ascendance to the presidency of the United States. In addition to our warmest congratulation to you and to the First Lady, we have -- you have our fervent prayers and support as you proceed with the awesome task of leading our nation in accomplishing its great mission in our troubled world.

You also have our deepest thanks for kindly and personally inviting us to the White House for this commemoration of Greek Independence Day -- a presidential -- a truly presidential celebration of Greek and American democracy.

It was on this day, the 25th of March, in the year 1821, that the Greek people, after suffering for nearly 400 years of tyrannical occupation, stood up, a David against a Goliath, and declared their independence. They fought with astonishing bravery and against all odds, and established the free, modern Greek nation among the free nations of the Earth, bringing democracy once again to its very birthplace.

Today, as we offer tribute to the heroes who, with the help of God, produced the miracle of March 25, 1821, we honor them in this unique place which constitutes a preeminent symbol of freedom and peace, justice and democracy, life and abundance of life -- to use the words of Jesus from the Gospel of John. In this spirit, and in full awareness of the tremendous power, both personal and institutional, over the President of the United States, we feel, and we feel it completely and freely, that we can kindly ask you for your special assistance -- an assistance in resolving chronic injustices related to issues of religious freedom, human rights, peaceful coexistence, democratic rule of law, and the pursuit of happiness.

I am specifically referring -- and allow me to do that -- to the following three cases: First, the case of the religious freedom of our Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. This means the free and unfettered exercise of His All Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew's purely spiritual mission of leading the Orthodox Christians' world of over a quarter of a billion people; furthermore, his possibility to proceed freely and effectively in his pioneering work for the environment and in his passionate promotion of inter-religious and inter-cultural dialogue.

Second, the case of the well-known issue of the Republic of Cyprus; and third, the case of the name of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

We are confident, Mr. President, that you, following the brilliant example of Alexander the Great, you will be able to -- {LAUGHTER ; APPLAUSE} -- that you will be able to cut the Gordian Knot of these unresolved issues, and by so doing, enhance peace and reconciliation among the peoples included and involved.

The history of unbreakable ties and sincere friendship between the United States and Greece is well known, but there is a special connection prior to 1821. I speak of the famous Barbary War in Tripoli, Libya, North Africa, that involved the newly established Marine Corps in April 1805, a detachment under the command of Lieutenant O'Bannon, consisting of six American Marines, a company of 24 commoners, and another 26 Greeks with their own proper officers engaged the enemy. Seven of these Greeks fell in that battle on African soil, under the Marines and in defense of the American flag in 1805.

Mr. President, as I offer to you a memorabilia from this event -- it's a copy from the Archives of the Marines, including the names -- most of the names of the Greeks engaged in this war. That's for you.

{OTHER-SPEAK} Thank you so much. {/OTHER-SPEAK} {APPLAUSE}

I should like -- as I do that, I should like in closing, to call to mind that when Greece, a few years later, rose up in 1821, that was in part inspired by the declaration of the American Revolution of independence in 1776. This comes as no surprise as the love of freedom and democracy forges a bond among peoples that knows no boundaries of race, creed, ethnic origin, language or distance. And it also is no surprise that when the war of 1821 began, there were Americans of the time, the Philhellenes who traveled around the land, across land and sea, to help restore democracy in its native land -- Greece.

As you continue to lead our blessed United States, the world's greatest democracy, please know, Mr. President, that our prayers, fervent prayers, are with you, our First Lady, Michelle, your daughters, Malia and Sasha. And we thank you once again for the great honor of this noble celebration of March 25, 1821. {APPLAUSE}
