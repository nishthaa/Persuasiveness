Mr. Mayor, Governor Di Salle - I hope I really don't sound like this. {LAUGHTER} As you all know, the score was 3 to 3 in favor of the Pirates. When that is settled, let us settle this election here in the State of Ohio, here in the United States. Let me make it very clear, that as long as there are children denied a decent education, as long as there are old people who live out their lives without hope, as long as there are men and women who want to work and can't find a job, as long as there are 15 million American homes which in this country are substandard, as long as our rivers are polluted, as long as we waste our national resources, as long as the prestige and power of the United States is not moving forward, so long is there need for the Democratic Party, so long is there need for new leadership and so long are we going to make our decision.
In this country on November 8, in the most difficult and somber time in the long history of the great Republic, I believe the people of this country, who are devoted to the welfare of this country, are going to choose the public interest, not the private interest. They are going to choose to go forward, not stand still. They are going to choose national dedication rather than mediocrity. They are going to choose us and the Democratic Party rather than the Republicans. {APPLAUSE}
If we can lower the voting age to 9, we are going to sweep the State. {LAUGHTER ; APPLAUSE} 
Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you for coming out on Sunday. I really appreciate it. You have given us a great reception here, and I must say that if I am successful on November 8, I will attempt in every way to merit your confidence, and we will work at this job 365 days a year. We will move this country forward. I come here today and ask your help in this campaign. I ask you to join us. I can assure you that if we win, we are going to move. Thank you. {APPLAUSE}
