Thank you. {APPLAUSE} I know you are all going home so I won't hold you up. But I do come here today as the Democratic standardbearer and come and ask your support in moving this country forward. This administration has stood still and so has Richard Nixon for 14 years that I have been in the Congress with him. On all the great issues which disturb our country, minimum wage, social security, unemployment compensation, houses, roads, schools, hospitals, our parties have divided and we have divided, and the great questions for the 1960's are how is it going to be possible to move this country forward, build its economy, provide employment for its people. And there are 4½ million of them out of work today. Our steel mills work 50 percent of capacity and the Caterpillar lays off 4,000 in the fall of 1960. {APPLAUSE}
We can do better than that.
The Republicans have stood still on every great issue which affects our times and affects our country. I believe as in 1932, the United States is going to decide to move into the sixties, to provide work for our people, to strengthen our country, and set an example of what freedom can do around the world. I come here today and ask your support in this campaign in building this country of ours. Thank you. {APPLAUSE}
