Governor Brown, Congressman Bizz Johnson - I think you have all seen him this morning - and you know Mrs. Engle. She is traveling with us. Ladies and gentlemen: We want to thank you very much for coming down here this morning. We got the only good night's rest on this train that we have had in this last 2 weeks. We start this campaign in this State this morning, and I think it is most appropriate that we fight this campaign in the Vice President's own State, because this is where we can win this campaign in the State of California. So we will be all over it in the next few days. We are coming back in October. I don't think anyone in this State who has lived here in the last few years, who has seen the same problems in California that the whole United States is going to face in the next 10 or 20 years, can possibly say that this election makes no difference. If we are going to move ahead, if this economy of this State and country is going to grow, if we are going to do something about education and development of our resources, if we are going to meet our problems at home and abroad, I think it is time we elected a Democratic Congress and a Democratic President. {APPLAUSE}
I understand I am going to be presented with something that is more valuable than gold. {LAUGHTER}
{AUDIENCE-MEMBER} On behalf of the citizens, I would like to present you with this keg of water, the best water on earth. {/AUDIENCE-MEMBER} 
Thank you. {APPLAUSE} The Governor suggests that we take it down to southern California and sell it. {LAUGHTER}
I will just pour out a cup at a time all the way down the State so they can see what you have up here.
In any case, I thank you very much for coming down. This is an important campaign because it is an important country, and because all of us are anxious to see the United States move ahead. I ask your help in this campaign. I think we can benefit and I think the place to win it is in the State of California. Thank you. {APPLAUSE}
