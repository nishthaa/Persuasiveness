Secretary of State, Mr. Holland, Ladies and Gentlemen. I am told that the M25 is the longest city bypass in the world, one-hundred-and-seventeen miles of motorway. That's as far as from London to Bristol. Of course the idea's been around for a long time. Indeed it dates back to a Royal Commission on London Traffic in 1905 and it was proposed again by Sir Patrick Abercrombie in 1944. Construction, however, only began in 1972. Nineteen miles were built in the 1970s and 98 miles since 1979. And as you know it's already proving its worth. It's cutting the time to the ports and to the airports, and it's allowing people to make journeys that they could not have faced before. And it's making life much more pleasant for people in many of our communities, it's taking heavy traffic away from our towns and villages, and from London itself. Of course, the road runs through some of the most attractive countryside, but great efforts have been made to blend it into the landscape, including the planting of some two million trees.

Now some people are saying that the road is too small, even that it's a disaster. I must say I can't stand those who carp and criticise when they ought to be congratulating Britain on a magnificent achievement and beating the drum for Britain all over the world. {APPLAUSE} Indeed some of their criticism puts me in mind of an old saying about Sainsbury's. The saying is "Nobody shops at Sainsbury's because of the queues". It's popularity is a mark of its success, not of its failure. Now as you know enormous amounts of traffic are already using the Motorway and that's why we've announced the widening of one major section of the road, and why we've announced the construction of a new bridge at Dartford. And to some of those who say "We always build our roads too small" we can only point out that at some of the planning enquiries those who object to the new road say that our traffic forecasts are excessive, and that improvements to existing roads would be enough. Fortunately the planning inspectors and the successive Secretaries of State have not accepted that viewpoint. Indeed I think you will all agree that on this great occasion as we open the last section, when some of our splendid civil servants have accepted the Secretary of State for Transport, and we have two very distinguished ones here today, wish to push on with this great highway, in that case they've always been quite right to say "Yes, Minister". And it's because they've said "Yes, Minister" to successive Secretaries of State and I know how anxious they were to get this complete, that we are here today.

This is a road of which we can all be proud. It's a showpiece for British engineering and our great construction companies and I would like to thank and congratulate them all on this magnificent achievement. Some of them have worked have on seven or eight British motorways. Some of them have worked on exports, roads, rapid transit systems, dams, great engineering projects all over the world. I know, several of the faces I see here today I have seen, whether it be in Hong Kong, whether it be in Sri Lanka, whether it be in other countries which take our engineering and these people export their talents for Britain. They are absolutely top-flight construction companies, not only in our country but in the world over.

And so it gives me very great pleasure in congratulating everyone concerned to cut the tape, and declare open the final section which completes the M25, this £1 billion investment in Britain's future, this great achievement for Britain. {APPLAUSE}
