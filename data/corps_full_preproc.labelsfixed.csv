" Kerry on Iraq: ""This May be Our Last Chance to Get It Right"" ",0
"... rejecting his call for closer ties  even with Great Britain  ""The Wall Street Journal"" said that the United States wants no alliance or anything that resembles an alliance with any nation. Well  some things never change.",0
But what was true in 1946 is still true today. America must lead a broad coalition against our adversaries. And we must be a beacon of values as well as strength in order to succeed. This is our duty. It's our obligation to those great leaders of half a century ago who set us on the course to victory in the Cold War  starting right here at Fulton.,0
So you don't come to Fulton to give a speech. You come to Fulton to honor a tradition and to give the country and the world the gift of hard truths and a sense of hope. ,1
"Both are needed today as we stand on the eve of the anniversary in this country of the day that major combat operations were declared over in Iraq  and the president declared ""mission accomplished.""",0
I don't think there's anyone in this room today or 6000 miles away who doesn't wish that those words had been true. But we've seen the news. We've seen the pictures and we know that we are living through days of great danger.,0
What anniversaries give us is the time to reflect  not about where we've been but about what might be possible  possible for our men and women in the military  the Iraqi people  and for allies all around the world.,0
This anniversary is not a time to shout. It's not a time for blame. It is a time for a new direction in Iraq and for America to work together so that  once again  this nation... ,1
It is a time for America to work together so that once again this nation leads in a way that brings the world to us and with us in our efforts. ,1
In the end  and this is common sense  understood  I think  by most Americans  America is safer and stronger when it is respected around the world  not just feared. ,1
To move to that place of promise and possibility  we must all see and share in the hard truths that are all around us. We know that there's no harder truth than when an American pays the ultimate sacrifice for our country. At this moment 722 men and women have fallen.,0
"Eulogies and rifle salutes and the last lone note of ""Taps"" have echoed around our towns. The sacrifice is profound and grief beyond measure  and the country's gratitude is real and eternal. ",1
I will share with you that it is a grief and a gratitude that lasts for all time because when I arrived here in Columbia  a big sign was held up over a fence. I didn't know these people were going to be there. But they were cousins  family members of one of my best friends who was killed in Vietnam.,0
"And they came here holding that sign which said ""Don Drow's country."" This is where he came from  Missouri. And the hard truth is that we know now that more lives will be lost until the mission is truly accomplished. And our duty is to make sure that parents  families and friends who lost loved ones will know that they did not die in vain. ",1
We also know that for more than 135 000 families  the ongoing burden of this mission is something that they feel every day. The truth is that there's an empty seat in the church pew on Sunday  there's an extra car in the driveway and one less friend to phone for a movie on a Friday night.,0
And the reasons that summoned Americans to service vary. It might be the story of a young man or woman that was called to duty on the wake of September 11  or by a family tradition of service to our country  or it may be a small businessperson who was called to Reserve or National Guard duty like Liza Spence.,0
We thank Liza for her service and for being here today. Thank you.  These are people who were called first for a few weeks  but now serve indefinitely. They answered the call of service. They did their duty. But we now know that our military was sent into battle without the right equipment.,0
Helicopter pilots have flown battlefield missions without the best available antimissile systems. We now know that roughly one- fourth of coalition deaths have occurred as a result of attacks on unarmored vehicles because we don't have enough armored vehicles to go around. We didn't send enough.,0
We now know that our failure to forge and to lead a true coalition has forced thousands in the National Guard and Reserves to be away from families and jobs for more than a year with no end in sight.,0
And we now know that civilians from half a dozen allied countries have been kidnapped  hundreds of Iraqi civilians have been murdered in terrorist attacks.,0
In addition  many of the Iraqi military and police whom we trained have refused to fight or fought inefficiently  and extremists in major cities are rallying  challenging our resolve and vowing to drive us out.,0
This is a moment of truth in Iraq  not just for this administration  the country  the Iraqi people  but for the world. This may be our last chance to get it right. ,1
We need to put pride aside to build a stable Iraq. We must reclaim our country's standing in the world by doing what has kept America safe and made it more secure before  leading in a way that brings others to us so that we are respected  not just feared around the globe.,0
This will not be easy  especially now  after the decisions of the last year  a hard truth that sometimes fails to get through the newspapers and daily reports. But we can accomplish the mission and we must  because I can tell you from personal experience  we owe it to the brave men and women who stand in harm's way at this moment. In America... ,1
_ Remarks by the President at Signing Ceremony For Afghan Women and Children Relief Act of 2001,0
Thank you all. For several years  the people of Afghanistan have suffered under one of the most brutal regimes -- brutal regimes -- in modern history; a regime allied with terrorists and a regime at war with women. Thanks to our military and our allies and the brave fighters of Afghanistan  the Taliban regime is coming to an end. ,1
Yet  our responsibilities to the people of Afghanistan have not ended. We work for a new era of human rights and human dignity in that country. The agreement reached in Bonn last week means that in 10 days  the international community will have a new partner  an interim government of a new Afghanistan. ,1
We join those in the interim government who seek education and better health for every Afghan woman and child. And today  with the Afghan Women and Children Relief Act  we take an important step toward that goal.,0
I want to thank Laura for her introduction  and I want to thank her for her steadiness during this crisis.  I want to thank Farida for her courage.  I want to thank the members of the House and the Senate who sponsored this piece of legislation  and all the members of Congress who are here today. ,1
I want to thank Sima Wali  who is the President and CEO of Refugee Women in Development  a key advocate for women's rights at the Conference of Bonn negotiations last week. ,1
I thank the members of my Cabinet who are here  Secretary Veneman and Administrator Whitman -- thank you all for being here. I want to thank the ambassadors who are here representing the diplomatic corps. Thank you all for coming. And I also want to thank Billie Holladay  for opening up this beautiful museum for all of us to come and celebrate this important piece of legislation. ,1
America is beginning to realize that the dreams of the terrorists and the Taliban were a waking nightmare for Afghan women and their children. The Taliban murdered teenagers for laughing in the presence of soldiers. They jailed children as young as 10 years old  and tortured them for supposed crimes of their parents.,0
"Afghan women were banned from speaking  or laughing loudly. They were banned from riding bicycles  or attending school. They were denied basic health care  and were killed on suspicion of adultery. One news magazine reports  ""It's hard to find a woman in Kabul who does not remember a beating at the hands of the Taliban.""",0
